# cva6-tools: Fetch-and-build scripts for CVA6 tools

This directory contains scripts for fetching and building specific configurations of CVA6-related tools available as source code.

The initial purpose of these scripts was to provide tool-wise reproducibility of working environments for the CVA6 verification flow.
However, they can be used as a building block for any environment requiring repeatable (re)building of tools from source code.

## Directory structure

Each subdirectory contains a set of scripts for fetching and building a self-contained component of the software environment.
 
## Quick start

Go to the directory of interest and follow the instructions in the top-level README.md of that directory.
